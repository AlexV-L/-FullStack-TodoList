# PROJECT - Full Stack Web Development Using the Cloud

Using Gitpod, none of the code or dependencies were installed locally, all was done using the cloud.

## The Stack

**Web application**

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a compiler to develop web applications. The application is styled with plain CSS.

**API**

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)  , the library & application framework powered by Svelte. It provides routing, server-side rendering and also enables us to develop a web application that works if Javascript is disabled.

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) , the object-relational mapping (ORM) library that let's us interact with the database. Based on defined models, Prisma generates the database schema and keeps the databsae in sync with our models.

**Database**

[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)  is the database choice for this project

**Deployment**

The web application and API are hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) whereas the database lives on [Railway](https://railway.app/).
